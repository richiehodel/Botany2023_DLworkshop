# Smithsonian Carpentries Slides

This repository contains slides for Smithsonian Data and Software Carpentry workshops. 

This repository is intended to be a centralized repository for workshop introductions, wrap-ups, and concepts from different lessons. 

For slides specific to individual workshops, it is recommended to use the individual workshop repository instead.
